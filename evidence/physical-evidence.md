## Conclusion

Physical evidence provides **powerful independent corroboration** of the prosecution case. The photographs alone—described as a "vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls"—constitute direct evidence of the criminal enterprise.

The combination of massage equipment, photographs, contact books, and consciousness-of-guilt evidence (hidden safe, false passport) creates an overwhelming physical case supporting all charged offenses.
