| Peak abuse | 5 years (2001-2006) | Highest activity |

## Conclusion

The timeline reveals a 15+ year pattern of systematic abuse that continued through multiple intervention opportunities. The 2005-2007 investigation should have resulted in federal prosecution and incarceration. Instead, the NPA allowed abuse to continue for another decade.

The 2019 SDNY prosecution represented the justice system's second—and last—opportunity to hold Epstein accountable. His death denied victims their day in court, though the Maxwell conviction partially vindicated the prosecution theory.
