## Sentencing Considerations

### Guidelines Calculation

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Multiple victims | Upward adjustment |
| Pattern of activity | Upward adjustment |
| Age of victims | Upward adjustment |
| Leadership role | Upward adjustment |
| Obstruction | Upward adjustment |

### Consecutive vs. Concurrent

Federal guidelines permit consecutive sentences for:
- Different victims
- Different time periods
- Different locations

---

## Constitutional Considerations

### Commerce Clause

Challenged but upheld: Federal regulation of sex trafficking under commerce power.

### Due Process

Defense may argue:
- Vagueness challenges (generally unsuccessful)
- Notice issues (generally unsuccessful)

### Ex Post Facto

Laws applied must be those in effect at time of offense, though PROTECT Act amendments generally apply retroactively to procedural matters.

## Conclusion

The applicable federal statutes provide comprehensive coverage for the conduct documented in the DOJ files. The elimination of statutes of limitations for child sex offenses enabled the 2019 SDNY prosecution despite conduct occurring as early as 2001.

The statutory framework was always adequate to prosecute these offenses. The 2008 NPA failure was not due to legal insufficiency, but rather prosecutorial decision-making that defied the evidence and the law.
